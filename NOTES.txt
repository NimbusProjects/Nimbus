Update: Shoot first, ask questions later.

-> Set Backtrack/LagComp to max of 16.00 Ticks, still trying to figure out how to go above that with some fakelatency sync or something... (b1g concepts)
-> Legit AA WORKS
-> Resolver HITS. (Still in beta)
-> ForwardTracking replaces Prediction.
-> ForwardTracking DOES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE SOME PING! Net_fakelag isn't as accurate as real lag either! This does fix a lot of the problems with the cheat not hitting anything when people are moving quickly.
-> I didn't track the majority of the changes I made, but I'm gonna try to start keeping track of them in the next update. GL HF !


-- Coming up next:
  -> BackTrack on Aimbot. (lol... op)
  -> Better FakeDuck. (aha, funny)
  -> BackTrack Chams Fix. (Nah, this will take awhile)
  -> FakeLatency.
  -> FakeAngle + FakeLag chams(it WORKS now, i just need to figure out how to get the real angle data, thirdperson fix might have to come first).
  -> Zeus/Knife Radius Crash Fix on join game. (wait, i forgot this...)
  -> Tweaks to Resolver. (i've been tapping OTC, Skeet, and Aimware V5 over the last few days, big shoutout to the HvH community + friends for helping me grab resolver data in private matches!)
  -> Movement keys display. (for you movement junkies)
  -> A lot more stuff.
  -> Some more thicc exploits.
  -> FakeLag on FakeDuck. (this is a meme, dw)
  -> Accuracy scope thing.
  -> GodMODE!?!?! (OWO) (pAA??????)
  -> Viewmodel Aimbot.
  -> This ye olde SmartAA concept i had awhile ago. (Something dealing with
  switching angles after someone shoots to a random position OwO).

-- Into the future.
  -> Scripting language support.
  -> Multi Directional Autostrafe.
  -> Idk, a lot more.
